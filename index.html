 <p>Re:Align Pilates is a boutique Pilates studio in Westmorland. I teach small affordable Pilates mat classes of up to 6 people &amp; Reformer &amp; other equipment at my private studio. Such small classes allow for personal attention and I can adapt exercises to suit individual needs taking into consideration injuries, pain, or special goals of each client. </p>
 <p><p>All Pilates exercises can be modified making a workout safe &amp; challenging for a person at any level, age or stage.  
Pilates works for a wide range of people - all ages (teens to seniors), athletes, pregnant &amp; postnatal women, people with limitations &amp; injures.  It helps you do better at whatever you you want to do whether it is gardening or cross training for an event. While many forms of exercise create an imbalanced body - tightening of certain muscles while overstretching others - Pilates aims to create a balanced body and is designed to cater for the needs of the individual.</p>
Whether you want to improve your flexibility, accelerate recovery after an injury, or simply make a positive lifestyle change, ReAlign Pilates Westmorland Cashmere has something to offer you.
 </p><p>I have been helping people since 2010 to improve their movement and posture. I would like to do the same for you.</p>
	<h2>Polestar Fitness Screening</h2><p>
	<p>The fitness screening allows me to assess a client &amp; determine their training goals &amp; appropriate exercises to meet those goals. I require a fitness screening before starting equipment sessions. It is also useful to do before joining a mat class group. It consists of 15 tests &amp; takes 40 minutes to an hour.  It allows me to determine the following:-</p>
	<li>specific &amp; general strength</li>
	<li>flexibility &amp; coordination</li>
	<li>posture &amp; alignment</li>
	<li>your starting level &amp; hence to assess progress</li>
	<li>how we need to modify the exercise to suit your individual needs &amp; level so that you can get the most out of your classes &amp; session</li>
	</p>
	<p><strong>SPECIAL Price $35</strong></p>
