  <h2>Core Strength &amp; Stability</h2>
	<p>Core strength is the foundation of Pilates’ exercises. The core muscles are the deep, internal muscles of the abdomen and back and also include the glutes, even the inner thighs to an extent. When the core muscles are strong and doing their job then they work in tandem with the more superficial muscles of the trunk to support the spine and movement. </p>
<p>As you develop your core strength (includes your back, bottom, lats, pelvic floor), you develop stability throughout your entire torso. This is one of the ways Pilates helps people overcome back pain. As the trunk is properly stabilized, pressure on the back is relieved and the body is able to move freely and efficiently. But Pilates isn't only about core strength it is a whole-body fitness that tones all the muscles of the body - especially the smaller neglected muscles and hence balancing out the body.
Pilates is fitness training that is designed to mimic and improve the kinds of movement activities that people perform in everyday life. With Pilates training, people sit, stand, and walk with greater ease.</p>

  <p><strong>Pilates</strong> is an ingenious and safe system of mind-body exercise using a floor mat or a variety of equipment. It has evolved from the principles of Joseph Pilates and can dramatically transform the way your body looks, feels and performs.  It teaches body awareness, good posture and easy, graceful movement. </p><p>Joseph Pilates was born in Germany in 1883; he was a small sickly child with rickets, rheumatic fever, &amp; asthma.  To overcome this he educated himself about anatomy, body building, wrestling, yoga, gymnastics &amp; martial arts. Pilates developed the mat exercises initially for Scotland yard &amp; the police force. During WWI Joseph was interned in a camp in England; to assist the injured soldiers, he invented some of the equipment from the beds and springs.  In the 1920's Joseph &amp; Clara Pilates opened their &#39;Body Conditioning Gym&#39; in New York City.</p>
	<h5>I invented all these machines... it resists your movements in just the right way so those inner muscles really have to work against it. That way you can concentrate on movement. You must always do it slowly and smoothly. Then your whole body is in it." - Joseph Pilates</h5>
  <li><strong>connect with your body </strong>- by breathing properly, correct spinal &amp; pelvic alignment, &amp; concentration on smooth, flowing movement. </li>
  <li><strong>learn to move efficiently</strong></li>
  <li><strong>develop a strong core </strong>- flat abdomin &amp; strong back - the core consists of the deep abdominal muscles along with the muscles closest to the spine, core control is attained by stabilizing the torso and moving the limbs.</li>
  <li><strong>gain long, lean muscles &amp; flexibility</strong> - many workouts tend to build short, bulky muscles (most prone to injury). Pilates elongates &amp; strengthens, improving muscle elasticity &amp; joint mobility. A body with balanced strength and flexibility is less likely to be injured.</li>
  <li><strong>create a balanced body </strong>- a lot of workouts tend to work the same muscles so weak muscles tend to get weaker &amp; strong muscles tend to get stronger. The result is muscular imbalance - a primary cause of injury and chronic back pain.&nbsp;</p>
